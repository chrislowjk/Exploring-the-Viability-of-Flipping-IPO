# Exploring-the-Viability-of-Flipping-IPO

Among the various short-term trading strategies, there is one prevalent and yet controversial method that can be traced back to the origin of a stock being listed on the exchange. With new common stock issues closing as high as 200% on the first day of trading, it is of little surprise that many have turned to the flipping of IPO for quick and easy profit. 

However, one might question the feasibility and soundness of flipping IPO as strategy of such nature seems to bear a more striking resemblance to speculation than to prudent investment management. This project aims to employ a statistical approach to investigate the viability of flipping IPO as well as the potential profitability of such method.
